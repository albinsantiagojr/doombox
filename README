Hello ALL,

This is my website i created using django for 
the backend, also used REST Framework for the api.
For the frontend this was my first time using any 
Javascript but after a lot of stack overflow 
and youtube i was able to get it going okay.
I did encounter an issue i have yet to solve and 
that is the redirect at the create page, for some reason
i can only redirect to the spotify login API from the update settings page.

Anyways, this project was fun and i had a lot of fun learning javascript and using my 
python knowledge for the backend. I will also say that i really like rest API so far
i have had such an easy time with it.

ill continue you ton update on this, but not top priority at the moment,
i would really liek to make something more robust using react and django, big fan of those 
two frameworks right now and REST API
